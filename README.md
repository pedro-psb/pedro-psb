### Hello! I'm Pedro Pessoa ðŸ‘‹

I'm a python backend developer from Brazil.

**Bio:** My story as a developer begins back on my early teenage days when I did some monkey coded games with ðŸ™ˆ ActionScript ðŸ™Š. After highschool I've tried to get into other fields, first architecture and then music, but neither of them did work for me. Now that I've got back into programming I can clearly see how much I reeeally like it ðŸ˜Š
